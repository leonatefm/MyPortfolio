							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>IBM Watson Classroom is a K-12 offering that helps teachers deliver truly personalized learning to improve student outcomes, powered by the industry-leading cognitive computing technology IBM Watson provides. With IBM Watson Classroom, teachers can gain insights to understand the needs, strengths, weaknesses, interests, learning styles and aptitude of every student and craft personalized learning activities based on that 360-degree student view. It is a revolutionary education solution with an intuitive, teacher-focused interface that we designed with teachers and for teachers.</p>

								<h6>IBM Watson Education : Personalizing the teaching and learning experience</h6>
							</div>
							<br />
							<p>Watson Classroom is comprised of an iOS App Element and a web App Enlight. Element is exclusively designed for iPad, which provides teachers a single 360-degree view of students by consolidating various academic, social and behavioral data sources. These insights generate suggestions on how best to help each student so they receive targeted support in the classroom more quickly. Meanwhile Enlight offers a unique browser-based experience for teachers to access not only deeper and more comprehensive insights of their classes and students, but also curated, personalized learning content and activities to align with each student’s needs.</p>

							<p>Element, as a mobile solution, focuses on teachers' engagement experience with students while walking around in the classroom. Enlight, as a desktop solution, focuses on the tracking and planning experience when teachers sitting down in the office. Leveraging the respective advantages for each type of the devices, Element and Enlight solve different problems in different context and user scenarios. Behind the scene, Element and Enlight grow in a common platform running with the same data and services, and together they constitute the complete Watson Classroom solution that brings education into the cognitive era.</p>

							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p><b>My Role:</b> Front End Developer Lead</p>
							<p>After a two-years journey as a UX designer in my previous team, I decided to move on as a Front End Developer in the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/education" target="_blank">Watson Education</a> team to explore more on the other side of my career interest. Since then I have been focusing more on bringing design to life with code and promoting the adoption of cutting edge technologies and processes in the production and dev workflow. Later on, I have also expanded my responsibility to help with the product roadmap, release and sprint planning, agile practice improvement, new dev onboarding and mentoring, from which I gained more leadership experience and skills. Started from April 2018, I officially step up as the Front End Developer Lead to continually work with leadership team, offering managers, designers and the rest of the engineer team to deliver products that aligned with organization value proposition, business strategy, customer priorities and user-centered design intent.</p>

							<h2>Research & Design</h2>
							<p>As what I described about my role above, this time I'm wearing more an engineer hat rather than a designer hat In this project. But we dive into the technology world, let's first take a quick glance at the some of the research and design work the team put together so that we can understand the story better. Since the first day it was born, Watson Education have been a team that persistently learn, practice and adopt the IBM Design Thinking framework to solve our users’ problems at the speed and scale. So first question to ask, who are our users and what problems they are facing?</p>
							<h3>Meet Jamie</h3>
							<p>Jamie is a 7th grade math teacher at a medium-sized public school in San Francisco. Jamie is married and has a 4-year old son. She loves her students, but struggles to balance her dedication to teaching with finding time for her family. She has a wide range of students each year and works to ensure all their needs are met. She wishes she knew more about her students going into the new year and had a better way to keep track of their progress throughout the year. She thrives on helping her students succeed. While we also have created personas for elementary teacher as well as principal/superintendent, so far we've been focusing on helping Jamie as the primary persona that represents the main user group from our client schools and districts. </p>
							<div class="multimedia">
								<img class="img-with-border deferred" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" data-src="images/iwc/persona_jamie.jpg" alt="Teacher Persona - Jamie">
							</div>
							<br />
							<h3>Jamie's Challenges</h3>
							<p>In high-level summary, Jamie, just like other teachers in the K-12 education industry, is under enormous pressure to assess her students, ensure their mastery and meet state standards. However, there’s very little time for her to develop plans that keep students engaged, and personalize learning experiences based on a deeper knowledge of students’ interests, strengths and weaknesses. The causes of these challenges are a complex mix, including but not limited to the disparate sources of student information, lack timely awareness of student performance and difficulty to find related, targeted and trusted learning contents.</p>
							<h3>Restless Reinvention</h3>
							<p>Watson Classroom is a product we designed for teachers, and more importantly we designed it with teachers. With the help from all the teachers participated in the sponsor user program, we not only gain insights about themselves: their goals, daily tasks, challenges, frustrations and desires, but also collect their feedbacks about our ideas, explorations, prototypes and product releases in a regular basis. The design team has been taking the problems and solutions as an ongoing conversation with our users, and restlessly iterate the design in a continuous cycle of observing, reflecting, and making. Given the non-disclosure agreement, I can't elaborate the details here about how our design solves Jamie's pain points and the rationale behind it, but the essential is that we closely collaborate with teachers and strive for a revolutionary education experience to make teachers' lives easier and help them success.</p>

							<h2>Bring It To Life</h2>
							<p>Much as I'd like to deep dive into the tech stack behind the glass of Watson Classroom and how we leverage Watson's cognitive capabilities to solve teachers' problems, I can't disclosure much details in this article. Even though, I think it still makes sense for me to go through some of the contribution I made in the production workflow improvement and team development in general. Watson Education was like a unfledged startup organization within the Big Blue IBM, and the front end team was also very young and still inexperienced at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cloud computing and human-centered design. Since the first day I joined, I've been observing and learning the challenges and inhibitors of the team and dedicating myself to the adoption of modern technology and methods to optimize product performance and scalability, improve code quality and dev workflow, foster a culture of embracing agile development and continuous delivery.</p>
							<h3>Design Guideline & UI Toolkit</h3>
							<p>Benefiting from being geographical co-located with the design team in the Austin studio, I was able to work closely with my designers on defining the design guideline and lead the work to "translate" the design language into a UI toolkit that the front end team can leverage in daily development tasks. This UI toolkit is a modularized components library implemented in AngularJS and SCSS. As the design style guide grows and evolves in a living Sketch file, the front end team also actively maintain this components library to be aligned with the design doc in parallel with other release work. All the time and effort we invested is totally worthwhile with the return in lots of ways: significant reduction in design specs work and communication cost, confidence of accessibility and consistency of the experience we delivered across the product, ease of implementation and maintenance with high quality reusable code.</p>

							</div>
							<br /><br />
							<h3>Git Workflow & Branching Model</h3>
							<p>Back to the time I got onboard, the dev team just completed the big migration from IBM RTC to Github Enterprise. While most of the engineers felt comfortable using basic git features to commit and push codes, there was neither standardized git workflow nor clear branching model for a long time to guide the team organize their codebase and manage releases. In the meantime, the leadership team was visioning a transition to a continuous delivery release strategy, but I knew it's hardly feasible without improving the development processing. With that in my mind, I spent around three months doing research, putting together a proposal, getting buy-ins from the leadership and management, and finally educating the broader dev team to get everyone onboard.</p>
							<div class="multimedia-group">
								<figure><img class="img-with-border deferred" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" data-src="images/iwc/git_1.jpg" alt="Git Workflow Goals"></figure>

							</div>
							<br />
							<p>The outcome of this activity is highly recognized and well appreciated by the entire production team. Here are some nice words from one of the dev leads:</p>
							<div class="quote-box">
								<p class="quote ion-quote">Chengqi was instrumental in reinventing our development process toward feature branching, enabling a much cleaner and always releasable mainline codebase, which results in greater team agility. On a broader level, this was a key step toward continuous delivery, which will definitely drive business results. On a more detailed level, Chengqi not only came up with the proposal, he provided detailed Git instructions for the development team on how to implement feature branching to get buy-ins from developers, and also a nicely designed presentation deck to get buy-ins from development leaders. Overall, it was a tremendous contribution to the team.</p>

							<h3>Task Automation With Gulp</h3>
							<p>Modern web app development has front loaded a lot of responsibilities from the server end to the client end. Watson Classroom Enlight is no exception, in addition to creating and rendering the interfaces, our front end application needs to take care of many more things like Ajax data loading, data manipulating, page routing and so on so forth. While the app continuously grows, we find out the team doing tons of repetitive tasks to work with and maintain the more and more bulky codebase. Thus, I introduced Gulp to the team to automate those painful and time-consuming tasks and streamline front end development workflow. Here is a rough list of the tasks I built up with Gulp and its ecosystem:</p>
							<ul class="parallel-list">
								<li>Sass to CSS compilation</li>
								<li>Automated CSS vendor prefixes processing</li>
								<li>Embedding HTML templates into AngularJS</li>
								<li>Bundling and minifying libraries and stylesheets</li>
								<li>Automated SVG icon cleanup and sprite generation</li>
								<li>Automated browser refresh and sync</li>
								<li>Automated unit tests</li>
								<li>One step app build process for deployment</li>
							</ul>
							<br /><br />
							<h3>Squads & Scrums</h3>
							<p>Applying agile development practices is especially challenging in a team that is distributed across multiple time zones and regions of the world. Our global leadership and management team has never stopped learning, exploring, pushing and reflecting to seek for the most proper and practical agile methods and practices that work for this team. As part of that, I work effectively with them to propose, implement and standardize the squads and scrums approach with the goal of facilitating collaboration and achieving alignments across function units and production teams. During each release and sprint, I actively participate in leading squads to do daily virtual stand-ups through Slack, weekly scrums through online meetings and sprint showcase and retrospection with the broad production team. Through all the ups and downs, we together foster a team culture with a passion to be more agile, more productive, and more responsive to the market, customers and partners.</p>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>Enterprise organizations today are at a critical intersection of increasing data growth and declining data value, creating a ripple effect across the business and exposing the organization to increasing expense, as well as legal and compliance risk. From daily emails, HR records to private client documents, companys are producing unfathomable amount of data every single day. Not only it costs exorbitant expense to retain all of those data accumulated day by day, it also becomes a black hole when comes to corporate lawsuits. Companys involved in legal cases are required to identify, preserve, collect and export case-related evidence to the court, thus lack of insights into their data usually leads to the extreme risk and cost when going throught the litigation process. </p>
							<p>StoredIQ for Legal is an IBM product designed to optimize enterprise e-discovery workflow and legal processes as an indispensable component of the information lifecycle governance offering suit. We incorporated muitlple exsiting disparate IBM products and transform them into one coherent platform for the legal departments and IT team to streamline their legal hold notification process, enable the in-place early data assessment and facilitate data identification, collection and legal review. Our ultimate goal is to help enterprises improve their information economics strategy, lower information cost and risk, and maximize data value.</p>

							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p><b>My Role:</b> UX Designer & Prototyper</p>
							<p>I joined the Enterprise Contents Management team after the first 3 months design bootcamp hosted by the recently founded IBM Design Studio. With a mixed background in UX design and front end development, I took part in daily design activities like user research, concept development, iterative wireframing, usablity evaluation and I'm also responsible for implementing interactive prototypes for research and demontration purpose, creating and maintaining the front-end toolkit for the dev team based on our design guide to ensure a unified experience across the product.</p>
							<p>In the meanwhile, design is still a very young thing in this 100 years old technology company. So as a new designers deployed to an existing matured product team, I am not there only to help create one good product, but also I share the responsibility to evangelize <a class="text-link" href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/" target="_blank">IBM Design Thinking</a> on our global team, contribute in developing strategy for rebuilding the design oriented offering portfolio and transform the business outcomes eventually.</p>

							<h2>Context</h2>
							<p>The StoredIQ for Legal project was first born in an experimental pilot program during the designcamp in which IBM Design Studio connects the new hired designers with product teams to practice and advocate IBM Design Thinking in the field while proving the postive business impact design can make to the organization. So the project I was assigned to during the designcamp was called "ILG-Next" - which later turned out to be the code name of the beta release of StoredIQ for Legal. </p>
							<p>In that pilot project, two other designers and I were asked to rethink IBM's existing portfolio in the e-discovery market and see how we could consolidate existing isolated clunky products to deliver a single, unified e-discovery experience. After six weeks' questioning, learning, collabrating and thinking, the small design team consists of three new graduates presented a playback to demonstrate the problems we found and some early exploration on the solutions. And that playback won the inital trust and confidence from business unit executives and the product team, which also turns this six weeks pilot project into an innovative offering that IBM wants to invest, earn and success. </p>

							<h2>To Understand</h2>
							<p>Lack of domain knowledge in the world of e-discovery and legal lawsuits in general was the first challenge we encountered. In the first couple weeks, all the commmon terminologies or roles in the field introduced a very steep learning curve for us to wrap our minds around what we are doing for this project. But understanding our users and their story is still the first thing we need to do before really doing any design. Benefit from the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/keys/sponsor-users" target="_blank">Sponsor User Program</a> IBM Design started to help establish the connection between the design team and real target users, we were able to find and work closely with several teams of sponsor users from different industries all around the world. It was that good relationship with our end users that helped us set the first step in the domain and go beyond.</p>

							</div>
							<br />
							<h3>Who are we designing for?</h3>
							<p>So the first question, who are the major personas in the story? To answer this question, the design team visited some of our sponsor users who can each represents a specific industry. We met them in person at their working sites, shadowed and observed their day to day business and interviewed all the different roles they interact with. Synthesized all the facts we learned from the users with the domain knowledghe we gain from the subject matter experts in the team, we developed a general user ecosystem model to present the e-discovery teams which usually have many players occupying different roles at different times.</p>

							<br /><br />
							<h3>What problems they are facing?</h3>
							<p>With a better understanding about the goals and tasks our key personas have, we then put together an As-Is journary map to demonstrate how they currently collaborate with each other in different phases of the entire e-disocvery workflow, how they think and feel during those activities and in the meantime to identify what are the pain ponts.</p>

							<h3>Where do we stand?</h3>
							<p>In addition to the user researches I mentioned above, we also spent some time learning and evaluating the exisiting IBM products we had in the market. As you may quickly feel dizzy looking at the screenshots, these "legacy" products are not delightful to use for 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. Although they do techinically solve a lot problems behind the scene, these products are more led by technology and only doing what we can do instead of being driven by our users and doing what they need. Unitl now, we finally achieved the alignment with executives and product manager about the business goal for this project: to consolidate existing offerings with a human-centered redesign.</p>

							<h2>Explore & Prototype</h2>
							<h3>Fail Fast</h3>
							<p>"Fail fast." This is a sentence I heard a lot during the designcamp when the educators talking about applying design thinking in a giant company like IBM. It is not only about the philosophy to do busniess, to be more responsive to the market, or to be more agile in development, it also makes perfect sense when designing products, especially designing enterprise level ones. The cost of fixing a problem after the product release can easily be a million dollar difference, compared with fixing it during the very early design period. Thus, paper prototype was the cheap way we  constantly took to do our exploration, test concepts and verify assumptions with users.</p>
							<div class="multimedia-group">
								<img class="deferred" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" data-src="images/siq4l/paperprototype_1.jpg" alt="Paper Prototype">
								<img class="deferred" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" data-src="images/siq4l/paperprototype_2.jpg" alt="User Test">
							</div>
							<br /><br />
							<h3>Be More Agile</h3>
							<p>After validating our ideas on paper with users, we usually started building our Mid-fi wireframes either using Sketch and InVision combination or quickly mocking them up using HTML/CSS/JS if they had more complicated interactions or animations that couldn't be realized in a prototype tool. There were two purposes of creating these Mid-fi wireframes: 1. they were used in our second round testing with a focus more about interaction and usability; 2. they were used as the medium to facilitate internal discussion with Devs/PMs about feedbacks, early story sizing or even get the Dev team started on technical preparation work if the design had been groomed.</p>

							</div>
							<br /><br />
							<h3>Push The Pixels</h3>
							<p>The last but not least stage was of course to deliver the final Hi-fi prototypes to the Dev team and push them to bring the design into life pixel perfectly. There was no doubt a lot fightings in the beginning with a traditional IBM Dev team for which it was the very first time to work with real designers in production. But with the continuous education about IBM Design Thinking, along with all the positive voices we heard from our users, the Dev team soon realized the value these new designers brought to the team. As we gradually won their trust, confidence and respect, the collaboration between devs and designers becomes more and more tacit and enjoyable.</p>

							<h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>
							<p>With the goal of creating a coherent platform that streamlines various enterprise e-discovery processes, a new solution that is capable to deal with new challenges in the age of big data and a delightful tool that makes legal and IT team people's life easier, we had successfully delivered 3 solid major releases to the market in the 2 years I worked there with the insanely talented team. For each of them, we created three Hills as the goal of this specific release, and use them to manage the scope, align the team and help everyone stay focused, and lastly to measure the business outcomes. Overall, the new product our team built together improved the legal hold and e-discovery process that was painful for both Legal and IT teams, helped our clients save money and limit their legal risk. We are all very proud of that. </p>

							<p>Designing for enterprise level product/service is not easy, and it becomes even more complicated when it gets involved with legal process. We feel very hard to build the empathy with our target users in the beginning cause they all live in a very specific domain that not a lot people are aware and understand. As a young designer, I feel lucky to be working on such a challenging but realistic problem as my career start point. It has been such an inspiring journey and hopefully also helped me become a more empathetic and reliable designer. </p>
							<p>When I saw those shining eyes of our users looking at the product they can't wait to get hands on, I knew I was using design to solve real human problems and make some people's life better. And that feels great. Among all the nice words we heard from our users, here is my personal favorite which always makes us very happy and proud about what we've conquered in the past two years:</p>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>The Michigan Engineering Victors Experience is a product started and managed by the Office of Communication & Marketing to help build and strengthen relationships between Michigan Engineering and its key audiences, including prospective students, peer faculty and institutions, alumni, donors and the media. In University of Michigan we have a ton of cool content we want to share with our audiences, so establishing an intelligent way to distribute interesting content to certain target audience group becomes really critical in the connection with them. And Victors Experience is one solid step we took toward this goal.</p>
							<p>This site mainly consists of three parts, a Javascript based client-side Single-Page Application, a PHP based server-side app and a custom Content Management System that it connects to. The client-side browser experience allows a user to view and customize their content based on their own preferences. The server app is basically an orchestra layer that handles AJAX requests from the client and return according contents from the CMS. Lastly, the CMS is internally used to manage our contents and user data. For example, some of our alumni are fairly high profile and we already know what they're interested in, so we will create special accounts for them using the CMS to input what types of content we anticipated them liking.</p>

							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p><b>My Role:</b> Web Designer & Developer</p>
							<p>I joined the <a class="text-link" href="https://cm.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Office of Communication and Marketing</a> as a part-time student-employee when I was in my second year pursuing the master degree of Human Computer Interaction in University of Michigan. During my half-year time there, I worked closely with <a class="text-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-c-collins" target="_blank">Ben Collins</a> who was the dev/design lead of the Victors Experience project. My primary focus was the front end web app design and development while I also helped in structuring the back end APIs and participated in some design work. Overall, it was a great in-campus opportunity for me to practise what I learned from the textbooks and apply that to an industry product that solves real-life problem.</p>
							<p><b>Design Tools:</b> Pencil & Paper, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator</p>
							<p><b>Tech Stack:</b> HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, PHP, Facebook APIs, Git</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Outcome</h2>
							<p>Since this is an in-campus part-time job I did as a student, so the outcome of the project is probably more about my personal growth as a Front End Developer and a UX Designer in addition to my limited contribution to the goal of the team to promote Michigan Engineering and enhance its reputation. Through this six months' project, I gained a better understanding about how a modern web app could be structured end to end and how the data architecture looks like in order for it to function seamlessly. I also learned a lot about what kind of slick animation we can achieve purely using CSS and how big impact that a little animation and that delightful moment can actually make to the end user experience. And all these little inspiration here and there provided me a totally different perspective to reflect on and rethink about what I had seen and heard from school.</p>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>Retina Wallpaper is a marketing website I designed and created to promote our amazing wallpaper mobile Apps when I did my internship with Appwill. Although it is a very young tech startup with only around 20 people, Appwill is a mobile App developer pioneer who saw the bright future of mobile internet market and the team has been devoted to creating products that can make people's daily life easier and better. With the early awareness of people's eager desire to customize their iPhones, giving the fact that all of them look and even sound exactly the same, Appwill designed and launched a series of wallpaper Apps that servers different user groups and most of them were occupying the top rank in App Store. Very soon, Appwill became to be one of the best wallpaper providers and gained millions of users around the world. By the time I was working on this project, we had reached <b>50,000,000</b> total downloads milestone from the Apple App Store. And this promotion site was born with the mission to extend the marketing channels to cover a much wider range of user population and to push that number even further.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p><b>My Role:</b> UX Designer, Web Developer, Learner</p>
							<p>I joined <a class="text-link" href="https://www.apptao.com/" target="_blank">Appwill</a> as an intern when I was a junior college student in Beijing. Back in 2011, I had just found my interest in the field of human-computer interaction, it was very much a fortune meeting this young team who centralized user experience design and offered me the best opportunity to get involved in every single stage of creating a product. Thus, I'd say my primary role during this amazing internship experience was a learner, learning from designers, deves, product managers, and whoever once stopped by my desk, talked to me, inspired me. And with all the help from this group of passionated creative workers, I then played a better and better role in the team as a UX designer and Web developer.</p>
							<p><b>Design Tools:</b> Pencil & Paper, Whiteboard, Adobe Photoshop</p>
							<p><b>Tech Stack:</b> HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Outcome</h2>
							<p>In the first 3 months after we launched the Retina Wallpaper website, it introduced more than <b>30,000</b> new users directly from this site, which contributed around <b>20%</b> proportion of the total App downloads in that period of time. It was really a thrilling result that exceeded everyone's expectation. The success of the Retina Wallpaper website not only opened a new window for promoting our wallpaper mobile Apps to desktop users. But also, it proved the concept that a broadly accessible website is a very effective marketing channel to attract new users from all the different platforms because this media is much easier and cheaper to be broadcasted with a quick overview of the product, some exposure of its trending contents prior download and even a place to see and leave feedbacks. Later on, we even added sections to introduce the team and job openings. We also launched several other promotion sites for the rest of products and all of them received quite well market responses.</p>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>Sweet Moments is one of the star products that Appwill created as the first generation of mobile social network service. Just like the App name, it is a community for people to share their beautiful and sweet memories with others, either with friends you are close to or strangers who are willing to listen. Human is a natural social animal and always has social demand. And back to 2011, the explosive growth of smart phone and mobile internet revolutionized the way people used to do social interactions for thousands of years. Sharing has never been that easy with the small device you have in your hand or pocket. Wherever you are, whenever you want, you can take out your smart phone, take a photo or even video, write a couple of words that pop out from your mind, and within 10 seconds, you can share what you are seeing, hearing, feeling or thinking with the rest of the world. It is a new era. And Appwill, as a mobile App developer pioneer, saw the bright future of mobile internet market and since then the team has devoted all the time and effort to create products that can make people's daily life easier and better. Sweet Moments is one of them.</p>

							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p><b>My Role:</b> UX Designer, iOS Developer Intern, Learner</p>
							<p>I joined <a class="text-link" href="https://www.apptao.com/" target="_blank">Appwill</a> as an intern when I was a junior college student in Beijing. Back in 2011, I had just found my interest in the field of human-computer interaction, it was very much a fortune meeting this young team who centralized user experience design and offered me the best opportunity to get involved in every single stage of creating a product. Thus, I'd say my primary role during this amazing internship experience was a learner, learning from designers, deves, product managers, and whoever once stopped by my desk, talked to me, inspired me. And with all the help from my friendly co-workers, I was then able to get my foot in the door of user experience design as well as iOS development.</p>
							<p><b>Design Tools:</b> Pencil & Paper, Whiteboard, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator</p>
							<p><b>Tech Stack:</b> Objective-C, Cocoa framework</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Outcome</h2>
							<p>Sweet Moments rocketed up to the <b>Top 100</b> Apps in the Social networking category in the Chinese App Store very soon after it's first launch. After hit the 3 months milestone, we've reached a user population of <b>50,000</b> with an extremely high <b>90%</b> retention rate. And around <b>70%</b> of the them turned into daily active users and started to generate more and more contents. One of our adorable engineers even created a really cool live-time data visualization to demonstrate the community activation, so every time a new memory was posted we can see a little memory bubble popping up in the monitor. It was such an exciting and inspiring moment when we saw so many memory bubbles floating around everyday.</p>
							<p>As you may know, the cold start is usually the most challenging stage for any new social network service, and the key of the way Appwill overcame this difficulty was a smart user diversion mode that introduced a group of elite users from the existing user group of our other Apps. And that first bunch of elite users contributed the majority of the high quality contents to the community which then brought in a lot more new users who were attracted by the interesting contents and the vigorous atmosphere. We also worked closely with that group of elite users to gain direct feedbacks about our product and selectively took that input into the rapid product iterations. With this healthy and sustaining user feedback loop, we were able to respond to our users and market in a very agile pace. Although we hadn't really figured out the future business model to bring in revenues, we started something small but solid that people love and enjoy using everyday. It's a fascinating experience for me to witness and contribute to the birth of Sweet Moments.</p>

				<p>I was born in the southeast coastal area of China, in a small, quite and beautiful town. But I was not a quite kid, in the reverse, I was always the noisy one with tons of questions and expressions. Fortunately, that curiosity has led me to many delightful advantages in my life. Delving into interaction design, is definitely one of them.</p>
				<p>An occasional TED talk, The Sixth Sense, opened the door of a brand new world for me, a field called Human Computer Interaction. I was so amazed and inspired by that innovative connection they created between the physical and digital world. And that impulse soon evolved into my desire to become a professional in this area, pushed me to set foot on the soil of US and pursue the HCI Master degree in University of Michigan.</p>
				<p>And now, my curiosity has brought me to IBM, to witness the inspirational journey of this big blue giant to adopt design thinking and transform business outcomes throughout the company. Currently, I'm a front end engineer in IBM Watson Education team, working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cloud computing and human-centered design, aiming to revolutionize the learning experience through personalization.</p>
				<p>With the goal of innovating the way human interacts with digital information, I'm eager to be involved with any freelance projects, opportunities & collaborations. Feel free to drop a message if you wanna talk.</p>
