							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>Enterprise organizations today are at a critical intersection of increasing data growth and declining data value, creating a ripple effect across the business and exposing the organization to increasing expense, as well as legal and compliance risk. From daily emails, HR records to private client documents, companys are producing unfathomable amount of data every single day. Not only it costs exorbitant expense to retain all of those data accumulated day by day, it also becomes a black hole when comes to corporate lawsuits. Companys involved in legal cases are required to identify, preserve, collect and export case-related evidence to the court, thus lack of insights into their data usually leads to the extreme risk and cost when going throught the litigation process. </p>
							<p>StoredIQ for Legal is an IBM product designed to optimize enterprise e-discovery workflow and legal processes as an indispensable component of the information lifecycle governance offering suit. We incorporated muitlple exsiting disparate IBM products and transform them into one coherent platform for the legal departments and IT team to streamline their legal hold notification process, enable the in-place early data assessment and facilitate data identification, collection and legal review. Our ultimate goal is to help enterprises improve their information economics strategy, lower information cost and risk, and maximize data value.</p>

							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p><b>My Role:</b> UX Designer & Prototyper</p>
							<p>I joined the Enterprise Contents Management team after the first 3 months design bootcamp hosted by the recently founded IBM Design Studio. With a mixed background in UX design and front end development, I took part in daily design activities like user research, concept development, iterative wireframing, usablity evaluation and I'm also responsible for implementing interactive prototypes for research and demontration purpose, creating and maintaining the front-end toolkit for the dev team based on our design guide to ensure a unified experience across the product.</p>
							<p>In the meanwhile, design is still a very young thing in this 100 years old technology company. So as a new designers deployed to an existing matured product team, I am not there only to help create one good product, but also I share the responsibility to evangelize <a class="text-link" href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/" target="_blank">IBM Design Thinking</a> on our global team, contribute in developing strategy for rebuilding the design oriented offering portfolio and transform the business outcomes eventually.</p>

							<h2>Context</h2>
							<p>The StoredIQ for Legal project was first born in an experimental pilot program during the designcamp in which IBM Design Studio connects the new hired designers with product teams to practice and advocate IBM Design Thinking in the field while proving the postive business impact design can make to the organization. So the project I was assigned to during the designcamp was called "ILG-Next" - which later turned out to be the code name of the beta release of StoredIQ for Legal. </p>
							<p>In that pilot project, two other designers and I were asked to rethink IBM's existing portfolio in the e-discovery market and see how we could consolidate existing isolated clunky products to deliver a single, unified e-discovery experience. After six weeks' questioning, learning, collabrating and thinking, the small design team consists of three new graduates presented a playback to demonstrate the problems we found and some early exploration on the solutions. And that playback won the inital trust and confidence from business unit executives and the product team, which also turns this six weeks pilot project into an innovative offering that IBM wants to invest, earn and success. </p>

							<h2>To Understand</h2>
							<p>Lack of domain knowledge in the world of e-discovery and legal lawsuits in general was the first challenge we encountered. In the first couple weeks, all the commmon terminologies or roles in the field introduced a very steep learning curve for us to wrap our minds around what we are doing for this project. But understanding our users and their story is still the first thing we need to do before really doing any design. Benefit from the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/keys/sponsor-users" target="_blank">Sponsor User Program</a> IBM Design started to help establish the connection between the design team and real target users, we were able to find and work closely with several teams of sponsor users from different industries all around the world. It was that good relationship with our end users that helped us set the first step in the domain and go beyond.</p>
							<div class="multimedia">
								<img src="images/siq4l/siq4l-sponsor-user-program.png" alt="Sponsor User Program Introduction">
							</div>
							<br />
							<h3>Who are we designing for?</h3>
							<p>So the first question, who are the major personas in the story? To answer this question, the design team visited some of our sponsor users who can each represents a specific industry. We met them in person at their working sites, shadowed and observed their day to day business and interviewed all the different roles they interact with. Synthesized all the facts we learned from the users with the domain knowledghe we gain from the subject matter experts in the team, we developed a general user ecosystem model to present the e-discovery teams which usually have many players occupying different roles at different times.</p>

							</div>
							<br /><br />
							<h3>What problems they are facing?</h3>
							<p>With a better understanding about the goals and tasks our key personas have, we then put together an As-Is journary map to demonstrate how they currently collaborate with each other in different phases of the entire e-disocvery workflow, how they think and feel during those activities and in the meantime to identify what are the pain ponts.</p>

							<h3>Where do we stand?</h3>
							<p>In addition to the user researches I mentioned above, we also spent some time learning and evaluating the exisiting IBM products we had in the market. As you may quickly feel dizzy looking at the screenshots, these "legacy" products are not delightful to use for 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. Although they do techinically solve a lot problems behind the scene, these products are more led by technology and only doing what we can do instead of being driven by our users and doing what they need. Unitl now, we finally achieved the alignment with executives and product manager about the business goal for this project: to consolidate existing offerings with a human-centered redesign.</p>

							<h2>Explore & Prototype</h2>
							<h3>Fail Fast</h3>
							<p>"Fail fast." This is a sentence I heard a lot during the designcamp when the educators talking about applying design thinking in a giant company like IBM. It is not only about the philosophy to do busniess, to be more responsive to the market, or to be more agile in development, it also makes perfect sense when designing products, especially designing enterprise level ones. The cost of fixing a problem after the product release can easily be a million dollar difference, compared with fixing it during the very early design period. Thus, paper prototype was the cheap way we  constantly took to do our exploration, test concepts and verify assumptions with users.</p>
							<div class="multimedia-group">
								<img src="images/siq4l/paperprototype_1.png" alt="Paper Prototype">
								<img src="images/siq4l/paperprototype_2.jpg" alt="User Test">
							</div>
							<br /><br />
							<h3>Be More Agile</h3>
							<p>After validating our ideas on paper with users, we usually started building our Mid-fi wireframes either using Sketch and InVision combination or quickly mocking them up using HTML/CSS/JS if they had more complicated interactions or animations that couldn't be realized in a prototype tool. There were two purposes of creating these Mid-fi wireframes: 1. they were used in our second round testing with a focus more about interaction and usability; 2. they were used as the medium to facilitate internal discussion with Devs/PMs about feedbacks, early story sizing or even get the Dev team started on technical preparation work if the design had been groomed.</p>
							<div class="multimedia">
								<img class="img-with-border" src="images/siq4l/midfi.png" alt="Medium Fidelity Prototype">
							</div>
							<br /><br />
							<h3>Push The Pixels</h3>
							<p>The last but not least stage was of course to deliver the final Hi-fi prototypes to the Dev team and push them to bring the design into life pixel perfectly. There was no doubt a lot fightings in the beginning with a traditional IBM Dev team for which it was the very first time to work with real designers in production. But with the continuous education about IBM Design Thinking, along with all the positive voices we heard from our users, the Dev team soon realized the value these new designers brought to the team. As we gradually won their trust, confidence and respect, the collaboration between devs and designers becomes more and more tacit and enjoyable.</p>

							<h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>
							<p>With the goal of creating a coherent platform that streamlines various enterprise e-discovery processes, a new solution that is capable to deal with new challenges in the age of big data and a delightful tool that makes legal and IT team people's life easier, we had successfully delivered 3 solid major releases to the market in the 2 years I worked there with the insanely talented team. For each of them, we created three Hills as the goal of this specific release, and use them to manage the scope, align the team and help everyone stay focused, and lastly to measure the business outcomes. Overall, the new product our team built together improved the legal hold and e-discovery process that was painful for both Legal and IT teams, helped our clients save money and limit their legal risk. We are all very proud of that. </p>

							<p>Designing for enterprise level product/service is not easy, and it becomes even more complicated when it gets involved with legal process. We feel very hard to build the empathy with our target users in the beginning cause they all live in a very specific domain that not a lot people are aware and understand. As a young designer, I feel lucky to be working on such a challenging but realistic problem as my career start point. It has been such an inspiring journey and hopefully also helped me become a more empathetic and reliable designer. </p>
							<p>When I saw those shining eyes of our users looking at the product they can't wait to get hands on, I knew I was using design to solve real human problems and make some people's life better. And that feels great. Among all the nice words we heard from our users, here is my personal favorite which always makes us very happy and proud about what we've conquered in the past two years:</p>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>The Michigan Engineering Victors Experience is a product started and managed by the Office of Communication & Marketing to help build and strengthen relationships between Michigan Engineering and its key audiences, including prospective students, peer faculty and institutions, alumni, donors and the media. In University of Michigan we have a ton of cool content we want to share with our audiences, so establishing an intelligent way to distribute interesting content to certain target audience group becomes really critical in the connection with them. And Victors Experience is one solid step we took toward this goal.</p>
							<p>This site mainly consists of three parts, a Javascript based client-side Single-Page Application, a PHP based server-side app and a custom Content Management System that it connects to. The client-side browser experience allows a user to view and customize their content based on their own preferences. The server app is basically an orchestra layer that handles AJAX requests from the client and return according contents from the CMS. Lastly, the CMS is internally used to manage our contents and user data. For example, some of our alumni are fairly high profile and we already know what they're interested in, so we will create special accounts for them using the CMS to input what types of content we anticipated them liking.</p>

							<p>I joined the <a class="text-link" href="https://cm.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Office of Communication and Marketing</a> as a part-time student-employee when I was in my second year pursuing the master degree of Human Computer Interaction in University of Michigan. During my half-year time there, I worked closely with <a class="text-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-c-collins" target="_blank">Ben Collins</a> who was the dev/design lead of the Victors Experience project. My primary focus was the front end web app design and development while I also helped in structuring the back end APIs and participated in some design work. Overall, it was a great in-campus opportunity for me to practise what I learned from the textbooks and apply that to an industry product that solves real-life problem.</p>
							<p><b>Design Tools:</b> Pencil & Paper, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator</p>
							<p><b>Tech Stack:</b> HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, PHP, Facebook APIs, Git</p>

							<h2>Outcome</h2>
							<p>Since this is an in-campus part-time job I did as a student, so the outcome of the project is probably more about my personal growth as a Front End Developer and a UX Designer in addition to my limited contribution to the goal of the team to promote Michigan Engineering and enhance its reputation. Through this six months' project, I gained a better understanding about how a modern web app could be structured end to end and how the data architecture looks like in order for it to function seamlessly. I also learned a lot about what kind of slick animation we can achieve purely using CSS and how big impact that a little animation and that delightful moment can actually make to the end user experience. And all these little inspiration here and there provided me a totally different perspective to reflect on and rethink about what I had seen and heard from school.</p>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>Retina Wallpaper is a marketing website I designed and created to promote our amazing wallpaper moblie apps when I did my internship with Appwill. Although it is a very young tech startup with only around 20 people, Appwill is a mobile app developer pionner who saw the bright future of mobile internet market and the team has been devoted to creating products that can make people's daily life easier and better. With the early awareness of people's eager desire to customize their iPhones, giving the fact that all of them look and even sound exactly the same, Appwill designed and launched a series of wallpaper apps that servers different user groups and most of them were occupying the top rank in App Store. Very soon, Appwill became to be one of the best wallpaper providers and gained millons of users around the world. By the time I was working on this project, we had reached <b>50,000,000</b> total downloads milestone from the Apple App Store. And this promotion site was born with the mission to extend the marketing channels to cover a much wider range of user population and to push that number even further.</p>

							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p><b>My Role:</b> UX Designer, Web Developer, Learner</p>
							<p>I joined <a class="text-link" href="https://www.apptao.com/" target="_blank">Appwill</a> as an intern when I was a junior colleage student in Beijing. Back in 2011, I had just found my interest in the field of human-computer interaction, it was very much a forturn meeting this young team who centralized user experience design and offered me the best opportunity to get envolved in every single stage of creating a product. Thus, I'd say my primary role during this amazing internship experience was a learner, learning from designers, deves, product managers, and whoever once stopped by my desk, talked to me, inspired me. And with all the help from this group of passionated creative workers, I then played a better and better role in the team as a UX designer and Web developer.</p>
							<p><b>Design Tools:</b> Pencil & Paper, Whiteboard, Adobe Photoshop</p>
							<p><b>Tech Stack:</b> HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Outcome</h2>
							<p>In the first 3 months after we launched the Retina Wallpaper website, it introduced more than <b>30,000</b> new users directly from this site, which contributed around <b>20%</b> proportion of the total app downloads in that period of time. It was really a thrilling result that exceeded everyone's expectation. The success of the Retina Wallpaper website not only opened a new window for promoting our wallpaper mobile apps to desktop users. But also, it proved the concept that a broadly accessible website is a very effective marketing channel to attract new users from all the different platforms because this media is much easier and cheaper to be broadcasted with a quick overview of the product, some exposure of its trending contents prior download and even a place to see and leave feedbacks. Later on, we even added sections to introduce the team and job openings. We also launched serveal other promotion sites for the rest of products and all of them receveid quite well market responses.</p>

				<p>I was born in the southeast coastal area of China, in a small, quite and beautiful town. But I was not a quite kid, in the reverse, I was always the noisy one with tons of questions and expressions. Fortunately, that curiosity has led me to many delightful advantages in my life. Delving into interaction design, is definitely one of them.</p>
				<p>An occasional TED talk, The Sixth Sense, opened the door of a brand new world for me, a field called Human Computer Interaction. I was so amazed and inspired by that innovative connection they created between the physical and digital world. And that impulse soon evolved into my desire to become a professional in this area, pushed me to set foot on the soil of US and pursue the HCI Master degree in University of Michigan.</p>
				<p>And now, my curiosity has brought me to IBM, to witness the inspirational journey of this big blue giant to adopt design thinking and transform business outcomes throughout the company. Currently, I'm a front end engineer in IBM Watson Education team, working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cloud computing and human-centered design, aiming to revolutionize the learning experience through personalization.</p>
				<p>With the goal of innovating the way human interacts with digital information, I'm eager to be involved with any freelance projects, opportunities & collaborations. Feel free to drop a message if you wanna talk.</p>
